## Introduction

*** Sometime 2020 ***

Life happens  
Many thoughts race into action  
Some real, some imagination  
Some dark, some funny and some with no situation  
Some random, some with a home and a mansion  
I imprisoned those thoughts with my pen  
Grabbing it while I can and making it stay in my den  
Giving it a shape, molding with a tape and forcing it to wear my apron  
For you my reader to discard, silently watch or relive the action
